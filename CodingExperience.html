  <h3>Josh's First Sample Website</h3>

  <hr/>
<h1>Coding</h1>
<p>
  I have had some experience in coding websites. I created 4
  mini websites<br /> that were one page when I was younger. It has been a
  while since I have coded a website.<br /> Before I only knew two languages and only
  the basics of each language. Now I know three<br /> languages and have more experience
  on html, css, and javascript. My goal is to learn two more languages.<br /> Well...
  the basics of the two languages. The two languages that I would want to learn
  would be Java and Python.<br /> Overall, I like coding and learning new languages.
