        <h1>Coding</h1>
        <p>
            I have had some experience in coding websites. I created 4 mini websites<br /> that were one page when I was younger. It has been a while since I have coded a website.<br /> Before I only knew two languages and only the basics of each language.
            Now I know three<br /> languages and have more experience on html, css, and javascript. My goal is to learn two more languages.<br /> Well... the basics of the two languages. The two languages that I would want to learn would be Java and Python.<br
            /> Overall, I like coding and learning new languages.
