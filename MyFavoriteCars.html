<h1>My Favorite Cars</h1>
<p>
  I have been playing "Need for Speed Underground 2" and I have had<br /> a sudden
  interest in cars. One of my favorite cars that I like is<br /> the Nissan 240sx.
  I have tuned up the car in the game and would like<br /> to have one in the real
  world. Another car that I like would be the<br /> Scion FR-S. I have liked the look
  of Scion cars but this car has topped<br /> all of scion's other cars. The look of
  the car is intimidating and is my type<br /> of good looking car. The last car that
  I am a big fan of would be the Mustang GT 500.<br /> I like this car for its acceleration,
  horsepower, and its top speed.<br /> I also like the look of this car because it looks
  like it is the meanest, intimidating,<br /> and beautiful car when the base color of
  the car is light blue and the decals are colored white.
