        One of my hobbies or actually activities would be playing Video Games. I only have 3 games that I really enjoy playing. I like the game series "Metal Gear Solid". I have recently played the first game in the series and I enjoyed it( besides the point of dying a lot in easy mode). I enjoy experiencing the story of Solid Snake. The challenging part of the game is to be stealthy. Another game I enjoy playing is "Need for Speed Underground 2". I like the game because I can modify my car from the interior part to the exterior part. I have recently created my car and it looks really cool. My car is pretty fast and has a cool design. My most favorite game of all time (for now) is "The Last of Us". The game is about a zombie apocalypse and you have to take care of a girl while trying to survive the outbreak. As you progress through the game you get attatched to the girl as your own daughter. Overall, I love playing games that have a good story and have an interesting playing technique.
