    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Josh and I am a 13 year old teenager who enjoys coding and likes to play the guitar. I enjoy coding because it is easy to learn and it can get me a job with a good pay. The Coding languages I know are HTML, CSS, and the basics of JS. I have created websites in the past and enjoy building and editing them to make them better. Currently I am working on this website so I can have more experience in coding. Also, I like to play the guitar even though I am still learning the basics.
