    <h1>Sports</h1>
    <p>
        There are different types of sports that I play. I can play Soccer, Basketball, Baseball, Football, and Swimming. My favorite sports would be Basketball and Baseball. The sport that I enjoy the most would be Basketball. Basketball is a fun sport to me because it is very competitive and it tests your skills. I like baseball because I like the feeling of pressure when you have to run as fast as you can so that you can get to base before they catch you. The other sports are entertaining and fun when you play with friends or with other people.
