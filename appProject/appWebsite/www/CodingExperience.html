    <h1>Coding</h1>
    <p>
        I have had some experience in coding websites. I created 4 mini websites that were one page when I was younger. It has been a while since I have coded a website. Before I only knew two languages and only the basics of each language.Now I know three languages and have more experience on html, css, and javascript. My goal is to learn two more languages. Well... the basics of the two languages. The two languages that I would want to learn would be Java and Python. Overall, I like coding and learning new languages.
