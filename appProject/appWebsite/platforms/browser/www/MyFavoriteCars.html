    <h1>My Favorite Cars</h1>
    <p>
        I have been playing "Need for Speed Underground 2" and I have had a sudden interest in cars. One of my favorite cars that I like is the Nissan 240sx. I have tuned up the car in the game and would like to have one in the real world. Another car that I like would be the Scion FR-S. I have liked the look of Scion cars but this car has topped all of scion's other cars. The look of the car is intimidating and is my type of good looking car. The last car that I am a big fan of would be the Mustang GT 500. I like this car for its acceleration, horsepower, and its top speed. I also like the look of this car because it looks like it is the meanest, intimidating, and beautiful car when the base color of the car is light blue and the decals are colored white.
