  <h1>Hobbies</h1>
  <p>
    I have more hobbies than coding. I like to play video games. I like to play
    adventure,<br /> rpg, action, and FPS(First Person Shooter) type of games. I also
    have been learning<br /> to play the guitar. Though I have put more attention to
    video games and coding.<br /> I also play sports. I play basketball, soccer,
    baseball, and football. I play these sports<br /> with my friends at school. To
    conclude not only is coding my only hobbie but also sports,<br /> video games, and
    musical instruments are just other hobbies that I have.
