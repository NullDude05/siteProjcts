  <h1>Sports</h1>
  <p>
    There are different types of sports that I play. I can play Soccer,<br /> Basketball,
    Baseball, Football, and Swimming. My favorite sports<br /> would be Basketball
    and Baseball. The sport that I enjoy the<br /> most would be Basketball. Basketball
    is a fun sport to me<br /> because it is very competitive and it tests your skills.
    I like baseball<br /> because I like the feeling of pressure when you have to run
    as fast<br /> as you can so that you can get to base before they catch you.<br /> The other
    sports are entertaining and fun when you play with friends or with other people.
